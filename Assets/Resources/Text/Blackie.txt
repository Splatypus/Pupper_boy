Bork! You scared me! I've been working on a new invention but I'm kinda stumped.
See that box over there? If you hit the button on the side it will power up some circuits I've made.
I just need you to fix them up. What do you think?

Nice work with that! Seems you have the basics down. 
Next up, pretty similar. Just note the colors that the circuit parts glow. I need you to make the end nodes glow the correct color.
Don't worry, this next one should be pretty easy. The white piece will glow the opposite color of anything it's next to.

Wow, you're pretty good at this! I got a few more for you though.
This next one is a bit harder. The red piece there needs to be placed next to two other pieces. If either one is glowing red, this piece will glow red too!
//Break 3
This next one is pretty similar to the last one. 
The blue piece here does almost the same thing as last time. If either part next to it is blue, then it also glows blue.
Oh, I almost forgot. If NEITHER color next to it matches it, then it gives in to peer pressure and glows their color instead.

Yap! Oh boy this is exciting. Now I know you’re smart enough to help me build my airship. Come back in a bit, and we can put it all together!
